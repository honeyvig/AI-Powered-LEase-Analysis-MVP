=============
To build an innovative AI-powered platform for document review, specifically designed for lease agreements, we will utilize advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to simplify the analysis of such documents. The platform will help users identify key terms, risks, and opportunities for negotiation, with future scalability to expand into broader contract analysis.

Here is a Python-based solution that integrates essential elements like document upload, text extraction, key clause extraction, risk assessment, and the foundation for a scalable and modular MVP:
Steps:

    Document Upload & Text Extraction
    Key Clause Extraction Using NLP Models
    Risk Assessment & Insights Generation
    Web-based Application (Frontend and Backend)

We will leverage PyPDF2 or pdfplumber for text extraction from documents, and use advanced NLP tools like spaCy and transformers for clause extraction, text classification, and risk assessment.
Step 1: Document Upload & Text Extraction

This is the first part where users upload their documents (e.g., PDFs), and the system extracts text for further analysis.

import pdfplumber

def extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path):
    # Open the PDF file
    with pdfplumber.open(pdf_path) as pdf:
        text = ""
        # Loop through each page of the PDF
        for page in pdf.pages:
            text += page.extract_text()
        return text

# Example usage
pdf_path = 'lease_agreement.pdf'
text = extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path)
print(text[:500])  # Print the first 500 characters for preview

Step 2: Key Clause Extraction Using NLP

We will use spaCy or transformers for NLP tasks. First, we’ll load a pre-trained NLP model to extract key clauses like "termination clause," "payment terms," and "liabilities."

pip install spacy
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

import spacy

# Load the NLP model
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

def extract_clauses(text):
    doc = nlp(text)
    clauses = []

    # Define keywords to identify clauses
    keywords = ["termination", "payment", "liability", "renewal", "penalty", "interest"]

    # Look for sentences containing keywords
    for sent in doc.sents:
        for keyword in keywords:
            if keyword.lower() in sent.text.lower():
                clauses.append(sent.text)
                break
    return clauses

# Example usage
clauses = extract_clauses(text)
print(clauses)

Step 3: Risk Assessment & Insights Generation

For risk assessment, we will use a simple approach of classifying sentences into "risky" or "safe" categories based on the presence of specific terms or phrases. For a more sophisticated solution, we can train a machine learning classifier to assess risk levels based on labeled examples.

Here’s a basic approach using pre-defined keywords:

def assess_risk(clauses):
    # Define risky keywords (you can expand this list for better risk categorization)
    risky_keywords = ["penalty", "default", "liability", "forfeiture"]
    risks = []

    for clause in clauses:
        risk_level = "Low"
        for keyword in risky_keywords:
            if keyword.lower() in clause.lower():
                risk_level = "High"
                break
        risks.append((clause, risk_level))
    return risks

# Example usage
risk_assessment = assess_risk(clauses)
for clause, risk in risk_assessment:
    print(f"Clause: {clause}\nRisk: {risk}\n")

Step 4: Web Application (Frontend & Backend)

We will now build the MVP, which includes a frontend in React and a backend in Flask or Django. Below is a simple structure for the backend in Python using Flask, which will handle document uploads, text extraction, clause extraction, and risk assessment.
Backend (Flask)

    Install Flask and necessary libraries:

pip install Flask Flask-Cors

    Create a basic Flask API for document upload and processing:

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import pdfplumber
import spacy

app = Flask(__name__)

# Load the spaCy model for NLP
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

def extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path):
    with pdfplumber.open(pdf_path) as pdf:
        text = ""
        for page in pdf.pages:
            text += page.extract_text()
        return text

def extract_clauses(text):
    doc = nlp(text)
    clauses = []
    keywords = ["termination", "payment", "liability", "renewal", "penalty", "interest"]
    for sent in doc.sents:
        for keyword in keywords:
            if keyword.lower() in sent.text.lower():
                clauses.append(sent.text)
                break
    return clauses

def assess_risk(clauses):
    risky_keywords = ["penalty", "default", "liability", "forfeiture"]
    risks = []
    for clause in clauses:
        risk_level = "Low"
        for keyword in risky_keywords:
            if keyword.lower() in clause.lower():
                risk_level = "High"
                break
        risks.append((clause, risk_level))
    return risks

@app.route('/upload', methods=['POST'])
def upload_file():
    if 'file' not in request.files:
        return jsonify({"message": "No file part"}), 400

    file = request.files['file']
    if file.filename == '':
        return jsonify({"message": "No selected file"}), 400

    file.save(f"./uploads/{file.filename}")
    
    # Process the uploaded PDF
    text = extract_text_from_pdf(f"./uploads/{file.filename}")
    clauses = extract_clauses(text)
    risk_assessment = assess_risk(clauses)
    
    return jsonify({
        "clauses": clauses,
        "risk_assessment": risk_assessment
    })

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

Frontend (React)

    Frontend (React) Setup:

First, create a new React app:

npx create-react-app lease-analyzer
cd lease-analyzer
npm start

    File Upload and Display Results:

import React, { useState } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

function App() {
  const [file, setFile] = useState(null);
  const [clauses, setClauses] = useState([]);
  const [riskAssessment, setRiskAssessment] = useState([]);

  const onFileChange = (e) => {
    setFile(e.target.files[0]);
  };

  const onUpload = async () => {
    const formData = new FormData();
    formData.append('file', file);
    
    try {
      const response = await axios.post('http://localhost:5000/upload', formData, {
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data'
        }
      });
      setClauses(response.data.clauses);
      setRiskAssessment(response.data.risk_assessment);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error uploading file", error);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>Lease Agreement Analyzer</h1>
      <input type="file" onChange={onFileChange} />
      <button onClick={onUpload}>Upload Document</button>
      
      <h2>Extracted Clauses:</h2>
      <ul>
        {clauses.map((clause, index) => (
          <li key={index}>{clause}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>

      <h2>Risk Assessment:</h2>
      <ul>
        {riskAssessment.map((risk, index) => (
          <li key={index}>{risk[0]} - Risk Level: {risk[1]}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

Conclusion

    Document Upload & Extraction: Users upload PDF files, and the backend extracts text for analysis.
    NLP & Clause Extraction: Extracts key clauses from the document using NLP techniques.
    Risk Assessment: Each extracted clause is assessed for risk, such as penalties or liabilities.
    Frontend & Backend: React frontend communicates with the Flask backend to process documents and display results.

This is a simple MVP that can be extended and scaled. You can implement additional features like payment integration, user authentication, and further machine learning models for deeper contract analysis in the future.
